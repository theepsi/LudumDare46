# Save Our Ship

## Introduction

    SOS, SOS!!
    Here the crew of LERJ-20 interstellar spacecraft.
    We are adrift in one escape pod.
    We managed to leave the ship after a terrible explosion that destroyed it.
    There is only few of us right now. The other ones weren't that lucky.
    Our situation is critical: we have very little oxygen and the pod energy is limited.
    We are lost at the Sector 37 asteroid belt.
    We cannot locate the nearest base of the Federation. Please, help us!
    Save our ship!!
